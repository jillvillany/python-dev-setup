### Configure Remote-SSH Editing
[Back to Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)

When project files are hosted on a Linux Machine, you can easily edit/ debug them as you would local files by taking advantage of VS Code's Remote-SSH extension.

To use SSH to connect to a remote Linux machine:

1. Open the Command Palette 
    - Mac: `shift + cmd + P`
    - Windows: `shift + ctrl + P`
2. Search for/ Select Remote-SSH: Add New SSH Host...
    - <img src="img/add-ssh-host.png" alt="img" width=500>
3. Enter the ssh connection command 
    - `ssh {username}@{ip}`
    - <img src="img/ssh-connect-command.png" alt="img" width=500>
4. Select the ssh file to update 
    - <img src="img/update-ssh-file.png" alt="img" width=500>
5. You will see a pop-up in the bottom right corner that the host has been added
    - <img src="img/host-added.png" alt="img" width=500>
6. In the Remote Explorer tab, you will now see your new SSH Target. Click the plus folder icon to "Connect to Host in New Window"
    - <img src="img/remote-edit-tab.png" alt="img" width=500>
7. A new window will open and you will be prompted to enter your password
    - <img src="img/enter-ssh-pw.png" alt="img" width=500>
8. Choose the folder in the remote machine you want to open and select "OK"    
    - <img src="img/open-ssh-folder.png" alt="img" width=500>
9. You will be prompted for your password one more time
    - <img src="img/enter-ssh-pw2.png" alt="img" width=500>
10. Upon successful connection, you will see the remote machine's ip as well as the git branch you are currently on (if opened to a git repo) in the bottom left corner
    - <img src="img/ssh connected.png" alt="img" width=500>

You can now easily edit and debug your code as you would locally. However, there is one exception. If you are connecting to the remote machine with a normal user (i.e. non-root user) you will get access errors when trying to run a ipynb file.

<img src="img/notebook-access-error.png" alt="img" width=500>

This happens because, in a Unix/Linux system, you canâ€™t bind to external facing ports without super user/root access. 

If you do not have an environment controlled with Puppet, you can try editing the user's permissions to not need password authentication when entering root user mode. However, it is easiest to just test small code snippets in a noteboook file locally.

## 5. Manage Your Python Package Versions - Poetry
[Back to Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)

### Install Poetry

- Install `poetry` with the following command:
    ```curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -```
- Restart your terminal
- Enter `poetry` and you should see a list of commands returned

### Use Poetry To Install Project Dependencies
[Back to Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)

**NOTE:** For demo purposes, let's pretend this project is dependent on Python version 3.9.6 and pandas

1. Create a `pyproject.toml` file using the following template (See this repo's [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/jillvillany/python-dev-setup/blob/main/pyproject.toml)):
    - NOTE: We are assuming this repo represents a project dependent on Python version 3.9.6 and a pandas version greater than or equal to 1.4.1

        ```
        [tool.poetry]
        name = "{repo/project name}"
        version = "1.0.0"
        description = "{free text description}"
        readme = "README.md"
        repository = "{git repo link}"
        documentation = "{site url if applicable}"
        authors = [
            "{full name} <{email}>"
        ]

        [tool.poetry.dependencies]
        python = "=={Python version}"

        [tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]

        [build-system]
        requires = ["poetry-core>=1.0.0"]
        build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"
        ```
        
2. Create a conda environment that uses the Python version specified in the `pyproject.toml` file and active the environment

    - `conda create -n python-dev-setup python=3.9.6`
    - <img src="img/conda_env_created.png" alt="img" width=500>


3. Run command `poetry install`

    - <img src="img/conda_deps_installed.png" alt="img" width=500>
    - NOTE: You will see a `poetry.lock` file created. This is important to be committed to your repo so that other team members can install the dependencies from the lock file by running `poetry install`


### Useful Poetry Commands
[Back to Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)

- Install the requirements in the poetry.lock file
    ```
    poetry install
    ```
- Add a package to the pyproject.toml file and update lock file
    ```
    poetry add {package name}
    ```
    - **NOTE1:** This will install the latest package version. The pyproject.toml will show a version greater than or equal to the version is required and the poetry.lock file will update to specify the specific version installed.
     - **NOTE2:** If you need to install a version other than the latest version, you can specify `poetry add {package name}=={version}`
- Remove a package from the pyproject.toml file and update lock file
    ```
    poetry remove {package name}
    ```
